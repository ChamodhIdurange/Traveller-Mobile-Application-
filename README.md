# Traveller

<p>Tourists love to try new things and explore new destinations. When they travel to new destinations that particular place may be unfamiliar to them and they tend to 
get lost more often. Because they are away from home and most of the time, they have no one to guide them finding places to accommodate, hiring a taxi, getting a guide etc. 
For the above difficulties “Traveller” App is introduced. Traveller is an app made for tourists and small businesses which is based on tourism. Our app provides the connection 
among tourists and tourism based local businesses to give a perfect holiday for tourists and business opportunities for the locals.</p>

<p>“Traveller” provides the tourists the ability to book any hotel in the area by searching for it and it also provides the users with the same type of 
help to find restaurants nearby as well. When the tourist decide that he/she needs a guide to help them in their journey, our app can provide that service as well. 
For the users’ convenience the guides are categorized into different types such as mountain guides, safari, and city guides. The user can decide which type of guide 
he/she needs and choose from those different variations. Another option the user has in this app is the taxi service. When a user is in a certain area the app could 
search for nearby taxi services available and then request for such a service if needed.</p>

<p>When considering local businesses our App could help them to get recognized among tourists. When new businesses such as hotels, restaurants appear 
in an area those details can be seen through our app to holidaymakers. The businesses could earn more profit by the tourists who use the app and 
then can receive more publicity.</p>
